# System Backlog

Bugs and improvements to the build system itself. Scan this at the start of each session. If a fix takes more than 15 minutes, it's either scope for the next build or it's not important enough to do.

## Bugs

- [ ] **Time tracking doesn't work.** The build notes template has a time log but there's no mechanism to track time. An LLM can't estimate duration without timestamps. Need a solution — either automated timestamps on phase transitions or a clock-in/clock-out command that logs to build notes.

## Improvements

- [ ] Add "Tone of Voice" section to sub-agent AGENT.md template for more realistic team dynamics
- [ ] Add "Context This Agent Receives" section to AGENT.md template (needed before scaling to full roster)
- [ ] Consider PM Mentor agent for process coaching (surfaced in Build 002 when Engineer drifted into that role)
- [ ] Set up Astro + Tailwind when site friction becomes real (at 3-4 posts)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md references from `site/` to `docs/` to match GitHub Pages structure

## Done
