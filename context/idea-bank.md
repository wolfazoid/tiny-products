# Idea Bank

Seeds, not assignments. Scan this when it's time to pick the next build. Follow the energy. Your Ideation strength will generate more ideas than you can ever build — the discipline is in choosing one, scoping it tight, and finishing it.

Add new ideas as they come. Mark completed ones with ✅ and a link to the published piece.

## Food Systems
- [ ] A food cost calculator that a restaurant owner can actually use without a finance degree
- [ ] A tool that visualizes the margin breakdown between farmer, distributor, and retailer
- [ ] A prototype for how a farmers market vendor could take pre-orders and manage fulfillment
- [ ] A system for tracking food waste patterns at a small grocery or restaurant
- [ ] What fresh produce ordering would look like if designed for the store manager, not the procurement system
- [ ] A tool that helps a small farm track which crops are profitable vs. which are vanity crops

## Local Business
- [ ] A scheduling or shift-swap tool designed for a 10-person restaurant team
- [ ] A local business visibility audit: what does a new business need to be discoverable in a neighborhood?
- [ ] A prototype for how a local service provider could manage referrals
- [ ] A tool that helps a small business owner understand which marketing channels drive foot traffic
- [ ] A system for how a neighborhood business district could coordinate events or promotions
- [ ] A "business health check" dashboard that shows the 3-5 numbers a small business owner actually needs

## Community
- [ ] A prototype for neighborhood-level bulk buying coordination
- [ ] A tool for a community organizer to manage volunteer signups and communication
- [ ] What a "local news feed" would look like if designed for trust rather than engagement
- [ ] A system for how a local nonprofit could track and report impact without enterprise software
- [ ] A neighborhood resource map that people actually maintain and use

## Bigger Ideas / Outside Thesis
- [ ] Work environment simulator — agentic teammates with Trust, Domain Expertise, and conflict dynamics. Simulate team friction, informed/uninformed opinions, and interpersonal dynamics. Potential applications: HR training, team building, conflict management roleplay. Could connect to thesis if scoped to a specific domain (e.g., restaurant manager practicing a difficult scheduling conversation). As-is, it's a different audience and scale than tiny products.

## Meta / Process
- [ ] The build system itself (Tiny Product #1)
- [x] Perspective panel — structured sub-agents for solo builders (Tiny Product #2) → `builds/002-perspective-panel/`
- [ ] A personal analytics dashboard tracking job search, content performance, and pipeline
- [ ] A template for how a PM could run a one-week product spike from problem to prototype
- [ ] A "decision log" tool for tracking product decisions and their outcomes over time
- [ ] Claude skills as a corporate standard — shared skill libraries for product teams to manage and distribute learnings across AI agents. How would an org codify tribal knowledge, best practices, and workflow patterns into portable, versionable skills that any team member's agent can invoke?
