# Who I Am

## Professional
Wolf Howard. Senior Product Manager, 10 years experience across e-commerce, supply chain systems, and operations. Currently at Public Rec (DTC apparel, headless Shopify). Previously PM at Interior Define (custom furniture, complex fulfillment). Run Feasting LLC, a product/digital strategy consultancy.

## What I Actually Do
I work between people and systems to make sure everyone gets along. I diagnose where systems, people, and processes break down, and I design how they should work together. I'm a systems thinker, not a systems manager — I care about how systems interact and where they fail, not about configuring fields in NetSuite.

## Background
- B.A. Physics and Mathematics, Saint Louis University
- Quantum computing research assistant
- Former mixologist and food expeditor at Square One Brewery
- Hosted "Feasting with Founders" podcast (food & beverage companies)
- Based in St. Louis, Missouri

## How I Work
- I ask a lot of questions before I build anything
- I think in systems and connections, not features and tickets
- I default to the simplest solution that works
- I write the way I talk — direct, specific, no corporate speak
- I obsessively eliminate friction in processes

## CliftonStrengths (Top 10)
1. Strategic — I see patterns and alternative paths quickly
2. Ideation — I generate creative connections between ideas
3. Learner — I'm driven to acquire new knowledge and skills
4. Intellection — I think deeply and appreciate intellectual discussion
5. Individualization — I see what makes each person unique
6. Arranger — I coordinate resources for maximum effectiveness
7. Restorative — I love solving problems and fixing what's broken
8. Adaptability — I thrive in changing circumstances
9. Input — I collect information and ideas
10. Relator — I build deep 1:1 relationships

## Watch Zones
- Activator (#28) — Starting things requires external triggers
- Focus (#27) — Sustaining a single priority is hard
- Discipline (#32) — Routine needs scaffolding
- Scope creep risk — Ideation wants to make everything deeper and more nuanced. Hard constraints are my friend.
