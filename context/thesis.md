# Thesis

Every product in this series explores one question:

**How do we give real people more control over the things that matter to them — their food, their business, their community?**

## Why This Matters

The most important problems aren't on the screen. They're in the broader systems that make the screen necessary. Technology has been built for enterprises, for scale, for optimization. The people who grow our food, run our local businesses, and hold our communities together have been an afterthought.

## The Domains

**Food Systems** — From farm to table, the systems that feed us are broken for the people who do the actual work. Farmers earn 20 cents on the dollar. Restaurant owners manage margins on napkin math. Grocery operators throw away 30% of fresh produce. The tools that exist are designed for chains and enterprises, not for the people on the ground.

**Local Business** — Small business owners are drowning in operational complexity that big businesses solve with departments they can't afford. Scheduling, marketing, inventory, payments — each one has a tool, none of them talk to each other, and the owner is the glue holding it all together.

**Community** — The infrastructure for local connection has eroded. The tools we have optimize for engagement, not for trust. What would it look like to build technology that actually helps neighbors know each other and support what's around them?

## The Point of View

- Build for the person, not the system
- Understand before you optimize
- The simplest version that solves the real problem is the right version
- Open source by default — let people take it and make it better
