# Quality Filter

Run every build through these five questions before publishing. If any answer is "no," fix it before you ship.

## 1. Is the problem statement about a real person with a real problem?
Not a hypothetical user. Not "small businesses." A person you can picture. If you can't describe who this is for in one sentence, the problem isn't clear enough.

**If no:** Rewrite the problem statement. Start with "I noticed that [specific person]..."

## 2. Could a VP of Product read this and learn something about how I think?
The write-up should demonstrate product judgment — why you chose this problem, what tradeoffs you considered, what you'd do differently. Not just what you built.

**If no:** Add more decision-making context to the Decisions & Tradeoffs section.

## 3. Did I make at least one interesting tradeoff worth discussing?
If every decision was obvious, either the scope is too small or you didn't reflect enough. The interesting decisions are where product thinking lives.

**If no:** Look at what you cut, what you simplified, what you chose NOT to build. There's a tradeoff in there.

## 4. Does this connect to the thesis?
Food systems, local business, or community. Every piece should clearly serve the series' central question: how do we give real people more control over the things that matter?

**If no:** Either find the connection or save this build for a different outlet.

## 5. Would I be comfortable talking about this in an interview for 5 minutes?
If someone asked "tell me about this project" in an interview at Nextdoor or Afresh, could you speak about it with depth, conviction, and specifics?

**If no:** It's not ready. Either the build isn't substantial enough or the write-up doesn't capture the thinking.

## Altitude Check
Before publishing, read your write-up and ask: is this written at PM altitude or Director altitude?

- **PM altitude:** "I built a calculator in React that helps with food costs."
- **Director altitude:** "I noticed that restaurant owners are making margin decisions on gut instinct because available tools assume a level of financial sophistication they don't have, so I explored what a tool designed for their actual context would look like."

Same work. Different framing. Always publish at Director altitude.
