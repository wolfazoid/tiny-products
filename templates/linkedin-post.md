# LinkedIn Post — [Product Name]

Keep under 200 words. The post drives traffic to the site. Don't put the whole case study here.

## Structure

**Hook (1-2 sentences):**
A sharp observation or question from the build. Lead with the problem or the insight, not "I built a thing."

> [Write here]

**Insight (2-4 sentences):**
The most interesting thing you learned or decided during the build. This is the meat. Make it specific enough that someone who never clicks the link still got value from reading the post.

> [Write here]

**Invitation (1-2 sentences):**
Link to the full piece. Invite engagement — ask a question, invite feedback, encourage people to take it and make it better.
