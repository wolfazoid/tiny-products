# Write-Up — [Product Name]

This is your space to write. Your voice, your thinking, your words.

Reference your build notes for raw material — decisions, tradeoffs, surprises. Reference agents-publish.md if one exists for the sub-agents' perspective. But the writing is yours.

Write it the way you'd explain it to a smart friend at a bar. Your natural voice is your best voice.

After drafting, run it through `context/quality-filter.md` before publishing.

## Title
Clear and descriptive. Not clever for clever's sake.
"A Food Cost Calculator for Restaurants That Hate Spreadsheets" not "Tiny Product #4."

>

## The Problem (2-4 sentences)
Who has this problem? Why does it exist? What does the current state look like? Ground it in a real person — even if that person is you.

>

## The Hypothesis (1-2 sentences)
Your specific bet about what would help. This is the product thesis — the decision you made before you built anything.

>

## The Build
What you made. Include screenshots, a working link, or a short video walkthrough. If it's a process or system rather than an app, document it visually. Keep it factual — what exists, what it does.

>

## Decisions & Tradeoffs (2-4 items)
The most interesting choices you made during the build. What did you consider and reject? What surprised you? This section separates you from every "I built this" post. Your build notes have the raw material — pick the ones that reveal how you think.

>

## What I Learned
Honest reflection. What worked, what didn't, what questions this raised. Be specific about which insights were yours and which came from collaboration (including with AI). End with a forward-looking thread that connects to the broader thesis.

>

## Try It / See It
Link to the working product, video demo, or instructions for how someone can use or adapt what you built.

### Altitude Check
Read the draft. Is this Director altitude or PM altitude?
- ❌ "I built X with Y technology"
- ✅ "I noticed [problem] for [person] because [root cause], so I explored [approach]"

### Honesty Check
Which insights in this piece are yours? Which came from AI collaboration? If you can't tell the difference, that's worth examining before you publish.
