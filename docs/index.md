# Tiny Products

<div class="thesis" markdown="1">
In the spirit of B.J. Fogg's "Tiny Habits", this is a collection of Tiny
Products. Each product is built to solve a real problem for real people,
with a special focus on the most pressing challenge of our time: how do we
recover a sense of local community from the flotsam of our exponentially
more digital world?

thinking with AI and letting AI think for you. Three sub-agents tested
against a real build process revealed where role-specific prompts
sharpen thinking and where they silently replace it.
