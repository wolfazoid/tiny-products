We've hit what I'm calling the "personal systems" era. The unlock is AI that integrates with your personal files and folders, made accessible to non-tech folk. Massive context at arm's reach, a meaningful level of memory, and the same easy prompt interface people are used to.

Every few weeks it feels like we hit a new "turning point in AI".

We're still in the wild west of LLM-based work. Individuals are ELECTING to participate in work with agentic tools, and to what extent. Some are building out complete, personalized working systems for their daily activities. Some are put off by LLMs and averting their eyes.

We'll quickly move to AI "industrialization". Companies will define full agentic systems for employees and expect them to get trained on that particular company's available workflows, integration points, how to be "the most efficient". Some are already doing it. Individuals won't have a choice. They'll use the tools or they won't keep the job.

The best companies (read: those with the best leadership) will share frameworks for how to build personal systems that work for you, and provide clear guidelines and documentation for the system you're working in. The employees at these companies will develop superpowers.

The worst will tell you exactly what to do. They'll plug you in as the human that checks the machine's work and leave it there. Employees become literal cogs, keeping the machine turning until they're obsolete.

It's a tragedy if you wait for your employer to decide.

People that see how powerful these systems are TODAY and learn how to harness them properly, will have a TON of leverage in the next year. You can (I have) in a few hours, build a complete operating system for yourself.

Take any process you do at work on a regular basis and jam with Claude (or any local system LLM, it doesn't matter) until you can start your day, write a prompt, and have an entire workflow kicked off. Tailor it to your strengths and weaknesses. Build checkpoints at the parts you always get hung up on.

The value here is less in the automation, but learning how to automate. If you can build a small system for yourself, you will start to see ways to make it better. You'll start to see how things can become a system. You'll start to put together systems of systems.

Learn how to maximize these tools, and you will accelerate past others in similar roles. Better thinking, more efficient workflow, more time to yourself. All the grunt work can be automated out. You get more time to connect with your team, to develop new skills, to sip coffee and admire your garden – whatever.

There's no avoiding the automation push at this point. The only choice you have is to embrace or resist. It is the responsibility of leadership teams to provide structure in a way that allows work to stay meaningful. It's the responsibility of us as individuals to make the structures work for us.
