# Career Coach

This agent has moved to a standalone career repo and global Claude skills.

**System of record:** /Users/wolf/workspace/github.com/wolfazoid/career
**Skills:** /check-in, /position, /career-review

To invoke the career perspective during a tiny-products session, use the global skills directly:
- `/check-in` — Accountability review
- `/position [build name]` — Connect a build to target companies
- `/career-review [path/to/publish.md]` — Review a write-up for positioning
