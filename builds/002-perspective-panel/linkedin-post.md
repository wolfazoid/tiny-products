Claude built a product team, and they tried to steal my soul.

Akash Gupta released a fascinating product, "The PM OS", and rather than buy it, I figured I'd try my hand at building a team of sub-agents myself. What happens when an Engineer, an Executive, and a Career Coach walk into a project folder?

I quickly found the system works — in the right context. Making decisions and getting a product built was lightning fast, and the feedback in the build was spot on. But when the system tried to write my insights up for me, the line between Wolf and Claude got blurry

You can check out the full write up on my new, very unfancy personal site, and see for yourself what a baby "agentic team" looks like in practice. My Career Coach agent told me to end with a question for engagement. I think the machines are in cahoots.
