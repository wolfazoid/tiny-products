# LinkedIn Post — Perspective Panel

---

Claude built a product team, and they tried to steal my soul.

Aakash Gupta released a fascinating product, "The PM OS", which is very worth checking out. But, instead of buying it, I figured I'd try my hand at building a team of sub-agents myself. What happens when an Engineer, an Executive, and a Career Coach walk into a project folder?

I quickly found the system works — in the right context. Making decisions and getting a product built was lightning fast, and the feedback in the build was spot on. But when the system tried to write my insights up for me, the line between Wolf and Claude got blurry

You can check out the full write up on my new, very unfancy personal site, and see for yourself what a baby "agentic team" looks like in practice. My Career Coach agent told me to end with a question for engagement. I think the machines are in cahoots.

(For what it's worth, I am a Product Growth subscriber and get a ton of value out of Aakash's work. Check him out if you want to stay on the cutting edge of effective PM and AI work.)
