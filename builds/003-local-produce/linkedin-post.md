# LinkedIn Post — Local Produce Finder

---

You have a 3% chance of getting local, sustainably grown produce when you go to the grocery store.

10 out of 372 grocery stores in Chicago stock local produce. At least as far as I can tell.

I mapped every grocer I could find in Chicago and tried to identify which ones stock good, homegrown, soil-loving, pesticide-free food. "Tried" being the key word.

High quality, publicly available data for where grocers source their food and which stores focus on local & regenerative products doesn't exist. The information lives in blogs, word of mouth, small community advocacy circles powered by the folks who already care. (Meanwhile, Italy laughs as they enjoy hand-made pasta from local grain and daily local markets in their city streets.)

This tiny product started as a quick proof of concept to make finding locally sourced grocers easier. It's become a fascinating snapshot as to just how hard it is to figure out where our food comes from, and an important question as to how we can make high-quality, sustainably grown food more accessible.

I'd love any and all feedback and ideas on this. What's your first impression of the app? What do you wish was built in here? Would you actually contact a grocer if you knew it would make local food more accessible?
